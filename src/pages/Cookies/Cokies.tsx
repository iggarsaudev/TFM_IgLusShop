          Accessing this Website may involve the use of cookies. Cookies are
          small amounts of information stored in the browser used by each
          User —on the different devices they may use to browse— so that the
          server remembers certain information that only the server that
          implemented them will later read. Cookies facilitate navigation,
          make it more user-friendly, and do not harm the browsing device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies are automatic procedures for collecting information
          regarding the preferences determined by the User during their
          visit to the Website to recognize them as a User, personalize
          their experience and use of the Website, and may also, for
          example, help identify and resolve errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information collected through cookies may include the date and
          time of visits to the Website, the pages viewed, the time spent on
          the Website, and the sites visited just before and after it.
          However, no cookie allows contact with the User's phone number or
          any other personal contact method. No cookie can extract
          information from the User's hard drive or steal personal
          information. The only way private information from the User
          becomes part of the Cookie file is if the User personally provides
          that information to the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies that allow a person to be identified are considered
          personal data. Therefore, they will be subject to the Privacy
          Policy described earlier. In this sense, using them will require
          the User's consent. This consent will be communicated based on an
          authentic choice, offered through an affirmative and positive
          decision, before initial processing, removable, and documented.
