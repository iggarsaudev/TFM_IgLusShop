            <h3 className="legal__info-subtitle">Categories of Personal Data</h3>

              <span className="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> are solely identifying
              data. Under no circumstances are special categories of personal
              data, as defined in Article 9 of the GDPR, processed.

            <p>
              The categories of data processed by
              <span className="highlight">IgLu's Shop</span> include both
              identifying data and special categories of personal data, as
              defined in Article 9 of the GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
              Special categories of personal data are understood as those that
              reveal ethnic or racial origin, political opinions, religious or
              philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, as well as the
              processing of genetic data, biometric data aimed at uniquely
              identifying a natural person, health-related data, or data
              concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the processing of special categories of personal data, the
              explicit consent of the User for one or more specific purposes
              will always be required.

              the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cases where the User must or can provide their data through

              related to the content of the Website, they will be informed if
              completing any of these forms is mandatory because such

                restrict the processing of their personal data. The User has
                this right when they contest the accuracy of their personal
                data; when processing is unlawful; when the Data Controller no
                longer needs the personal data but the User requires it for
                legal claims; or when the User has objected to processing.

                personal data from the Data Controller in a structured, commonly
                used, and machine-readable format and to transmit it to another
                controller. Where technically possible, the Data Controller will
                directly transmit the data to that other controller.

                This is the User's right not to be subject to an individualized
                decision based solely on automated processing of their personal

                Name and surname(s) of the User and a copy of their ID. In cases
                where representation is admitted, identification by the same
                means will also be required for the person representing the User
                as well as proof of representation. The ID copy may be replaced
                by any other legally valid means that proves identity.

              Complaints to the Supervisory Authority
            </h3>
            <p>
              If the User believes there is a problem or violation of current
              regulations regarding how their personal data is being processed,
              they have the right to effective judicial protection and to file a
              complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the State
              where they have their habitual residence, place of work, or where
              the alleged infringement occurred. In the case of Spain, the
              supervisory authority is the Spanish Data Protection Agency
              (https://www.aepd.es/).
